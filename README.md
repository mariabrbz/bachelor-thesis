# 2D Voronoi Diagram Applications: Branching Structures and Crack Patterns Synthesis

### Bachelor thesis - Mathematics and Computer Science, Supervisor: Pooran Memari

The subject of this bachelor thesis is motivated by different applications in Computer Graphics and Virtual World Simulation. <br/>
Creating 2D branching structures is a common requirement in computer graphics, as they can model different types of structures in many application fields. These branched structures could, for example, represent crack patterns, river or sewagenetworks, neurons or blood vessels in the human body. This research project uses the approximation of the medial axis of closed curves to represent such patterns, and its first purpose is creating an algorithm to it (edge filtering algorithm, displayed on the right side of the image below, compared to a pre-existing algorithm on the left). <br/>

The second part of the project deals with creating simplified 2D crack patterns using a Voronoi diagram maze generator. <br/>
